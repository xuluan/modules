# Gendata

## Objective

To generate synthetic seismic data by defining primary and secondary attributes and assigning different wavelets over time. 

User-defined Parameters:

- Primary attribute – such as, inline, CDP
- Secondary attributes – such as, crossline, offset
- Time maximum – The total duration of the synthetic trace
- Wavelets – Users can insert one or more wavelets, such as ricker or Ormsby wavelet & at specified time intervals within the same trace

## Key Features

- Supports multiple wavelets within a single trace
- Enables flexible modeling of synthetic data with varying wavelet characteristics across time
